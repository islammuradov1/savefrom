Privacy Policy for SaveFrom1
Effective Date: June 19, 2025
This Privacy Policy explains how I (“I”, “me”, “my”) collect, use, and protect your information when you use the SaveFrom1 application (“App”). Your privacy is important, and I am committed to protecting it.
1. Information I Do Not Collect
SaveFrom1 is designed to respect your privacy. I do not:
Collect any personally identifiable information (PII)
Track your usage or behavior
Use cookies or analytics tools
Access or store any content you download through the App
2. Device Permissions
The App may request permission to access the internet or storage on your device, but:
No data is uploaded to external servers
No files are accessed or modified without your action
These permissions are strictly required for the App to function (e.g., downloading content).
3. Third-Party Services
If the App interacts with third-party websites (e.g., YouTube, TikTok), their own privacy policies apply. I do not control or take responsibility for how they use your data.
4. Children's Privacy
SaveFrom1 is not intended for use by anyone under the age of 13. I do not knowingly collect any data from children.
5. Security
I take basic steps to keep the App secure. However, since no system is 100% secure, you use the App at your own risk.
6. Changes to This Policy
I may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When I do, I will revise the “Effective Date” at the top of this page.
